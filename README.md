# Google Search Console MCP Server
## 🚀 Introduction: Setting Up MCP Server  

In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the process of setting up your own MCP [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server, adding it to Claude Desktop, and integrating it with Google Search Console (GSC) data. This will allow you to compare time periods to identify SEO improvements, generate visual reports like bar charts and line graphs, and uncover optimization opportunities by analyzing click-through rates, impressions, and ranking shifts.

## 🔹 What You Need to Know
This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, and you don’t need any advanced technical skills. However, you should be comfortable running commands in the command line (also known as the terminal or command prompt).

Throughout this guide, you'll enter commands like:

```sh
python --version
git clone <repository-url>
```
If you’ve never used the command line before, don’t worry! Just follow the instructions step by step, and you'll be good to go.

That’s all you need— let’s get started! 🚀

# 🛠 Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while setting up or using the MCP server, try the following solutions:

## 1️⃣ Restart Claude Desktop
Sometimes, tools don’t appear immediately. Restart Claude Desktop and try again.
You may need to end the Claude process in Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) before restarting.
## 2️⃣ Wait a Few Minutes
After setting up the MCP server, the new tools might take a few minutes to load.
If they don’t appear right away, wait a few minutes and try again.
## 3️⃣ Check the JSON Credentials File
Ensure the service account JSON file is in an accessible folder.
Avoid placing it in a restricted or admin-only folder (e.g., C:\Program Files\ on Windows or ~/Library/ on macOS).
If necessary, move it to a more accessible location like your Documents or Desktop folder.
## :four: Check the Claude configuration
Go to **File => Settings** and click on the **Developer** tab. When you click on **Search Console Analytics**, it should display a status of 'running'. If not, there may be an error message providing details of what is causing the connection issue.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acfd8ea2-17d8-4d01-8132-18a913b99766)

Click on **Edit Config** and open **'claude_desktop_config.json'** in a text editor. It should contain:

```sh
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Search Console Analytics": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "google-api-python-client",
        "--with",
        "google-auth",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "--with",
        "pandas",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "C:\\Documents\\gsc-mcp-server\\server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "C:\\Users\\Path\\To\\Credentials\\gscaccess-credentials.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If it contains something else, paste this data into file and make sure you update the file paths for the server.py file and the credentials file. Make sure to escape backslash characters (as shown). Restart Claude.

## Mac Users: Fixing "spawn uv ENOENT" Error
If you see the error **"spawn uv ENOENT"** when opening Claude Desktop, it means that uv is either not installed or not found in the system path. If uv is installed, you can try adding the full path to the claude config.

### 1️⃣ Update the Claude Desktop Configuration
Open **Claude Desktop** and go to **File > Settings > Developer**.
Click **"Search Console Analytics"**, then select **Edit Config**.
Locate the `"command": "uv"` entry in **claude_desktop_config.json**.
Replace "uv" with the full path to uv, which is usually: `"/Users/YOURUSERPROFILENAME/.local/bin/uv"`

Run this command to get the installation path of uv: 
```sh
which uv
```

Save the file and restart Claude Desktop.

### 2️⃣ Try Another Installation Method for uv
If the above method does not work, uv may not be installed correctly. Try installing it using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install uv
```

If you're still having issues, retrace your steps and ensure everything is set up correctly. 🚀
